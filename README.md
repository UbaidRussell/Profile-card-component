## My process
    Mapped out the site and executed.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For the CSS we had to fade the background blots into the background and rotate them to align them up right. I learned how to do that with the following code:

```css
.blot-1{
    z-index: -1;
    position: absolute;
    rotate: 100deg;
    top: -400px;
    left: -100px;
}
.blot-2{
    z-index: -1;
    position: absolute;
    left: 900px;
    top: 500px;
    rotate: -320deg;
}

```

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.php) - We didn't have to do much research for this project but this helped me understand how to use background images in CSS.
